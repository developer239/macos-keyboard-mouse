## Since both RobotJS libraries are no longer being maintained, and as I had been working with C++ in the past month, I decided to start a new, more robust implementation. [I have implemented keyboard, mouse, and display controls that are very similar to the original RobotJS API ðŸ¤–developer239/robot-ts](https://github.com/developer239/robot-ts) (and should be cross-platform in the future)

# MacOS Keyboard Mouse

[![npm version](http://img.shields.io/npm/v/macos-keyboard-mouse.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/macos-keyboard-mouse "View this project on npm")

Keyboard and mouse controls for your Node project. Currently, only supports Mac.

## Libraries:

- [node-addon-api](https://github.com/nodejs/node-addon-api) - interface for building native addons
- [cmake-js](https://github.com/cmake-js/cmake-js) - native addon build tool

## Example

### Mouse

```js
import { Mouse, Button } from 'macos-keyboard-mouse';

const mouse = new Mouse();

// sets delay between pixels
mouse.setDelay(16);

// moves mouse to x: 100, y: 100
mouse.move(100, 100);

// presses left mouse key
mouse.pressLeft();

// presses right mouse key
mouse.pressRight();

// gets current mouse position
mouse.getLocation();

// holds left mouse button down
mouse.press(Button.left, false);

// holds right mouse button down
mouse.press(Button.right, false);
```

### Keyboard

```js
import { Keyboard } from 'macos-keyboard-mouse';

const keyboard = new Keyboard();

// types 'hello world' 
keyboard.type('Hello world');

// types 'm'
keyboard.click('m');
  
// presses "enter" key
keyboard.clickEnter();
```
